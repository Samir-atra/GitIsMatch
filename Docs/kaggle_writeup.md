# GitIsMatch: AI-Powered Open Source Matchmaker

**GitIsMatch** is an intelligent web application that leverages Google's **Gemini 2.5 Flash** to bridge the gap between developers and meaningful open-source contributions.

### The Problem
With millions of repositories on GitHub, finding the right issue to work on is overwhelming. Standard keyword searches are rigid and often return irrelevant results, leading to the "Paradox of Choice" where developers give up before they start.

### The Solution
GitIsMatch acts as a personalized technical recruiter. Instead of manually searching for keywords, the app:
1.  **Analyzes**: Fetches your public GitHub data (repos, languages, bio).
2.  **Profiles**: Uses Gemini to build a semantic "Coding Persona" (e.g., "Python specialist interested in Machine Learning").
3.  **Hunts**: Automatically generates complex, optimized GitHub search queries to find "help wanted" issues that align with your specific expertise.

### How to Use
Simply enter your GitHub username. The AI instantly generates a profile summary and a curated list of issues. You can further refine the search by clicking on AI-identified skill tags or adding custom technologies.

### Why It Matters
By understanding *who* the developer is before searching for *what* to do, GitIsMatch saves time and reduces friction. It helps juniors find approachable tasks in familiar stacks and assists seniors in discovering niche challenges, effectively connecting talent with maintenance demand.
